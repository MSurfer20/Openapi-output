### Example

```python
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.api import streams_api
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://example.zulipchat.com/api/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://example.zulipchat.com/api/v1"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient() as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = streams_api.StreamsApi(api_client)
    subscription_data =  # [{str: (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type)}] | A list of objects that describe the changes that should be applied in each subscription. Each object represents a subscription, and must have a `stream_id` key that identifies the stream, as well as the `property` being modified and its new `value`.  The possible values for each `property` and `value` pairs are:  * `color` (string): the hex value of the user's display color for the stream. * `is_muted` (boolean): whether the stream is   [muted](/help/mute-a-stream).  Prior to Zulip 2.1, this feature was   represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the   opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`); for   backwards-compatibility, modern Zulip still accepts that value. * `pin_to_top` (boolean): whether to pin the stream at the top of the stream list. * `desktop_notifications` (boolean): whether to show desktop notifications     for all messages sent to the stream. * `audible_notifications` (boolean): whether to play a sound   notification for all messages sent to the stream. * `push_notifications` (boolean): whether to trigger a mobile push     notification for all messages sent to the stream. * `email_notifications` (boolean): whether to trigger an email     notification for all messages sent to the stream. 

    # example passing only required values which don't have defaults set
    try:
        # Update subscription settings
        api_response = api_instance.update_subscription_settings(subscription_data)
        pprint(api_response)
    except openapi_client.ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling StreamsApi->update_subscription_settings: %s\n" % e)
```
